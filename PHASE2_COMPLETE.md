# Phase 2 Complete: WSL Node Ready for Ansible Management

**Completion Date**: 2025-09-07 09:32 AKDT  
**Node**: wsl-fedora-kbc (100.88.131.44)  
**Status**: ✅ READY FOR ANSIBLE MANAGEMENT

## Summary

This WSL node has successfully completed all Phase 2 preparations and is now ready to be managed by the Ansible control node at hetzner-hq.

## Completed Configuration

### ✅ All Prerequisites Met
- Python 3.12.11 installed
- SSH service running and accessible
- Tailscale connected (100.88.131.44)
- Control node (hetzner-hq) reachable via mesh network

### ✅ Ansible Requirements Configured
- **SSH Key**: ansible@hetzner.hq authorized in ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
- **Passwordless Sudo**: Configured via /etc/sudoers.d/ansible-verlyn13
- **Python Interpreter**: Available at /usr/bin/python3
- **Network Access**: Stable connection via Tailscale

### ✅ Local Ansible Key Pair
This node also has the ansible_ed25519 key pair locally, allowing it to:
- Act as a backup control node if needed
- Perform local ansible operations
- Test playbooks locally before deployment

## Verification Results

```
✓ Python 3: Installed (3.12.11)
✓ SSH Service: Running
✓ Tailscale: Connected (100.88.131.44)
✓ Control Node: Reachable
✓ SSH Directory: Correct permissions (700)
✓ Authorized Keys: ansible@hetzner.hq present
✓ Sudo Access: Passwordless configured
✓ WSL Environment: Detected and operational
```

## Inventory Configuration for Control Node

Add this configuration to the control node's inventory:

```yaml
# In /opt/mesh-infra/ansible/inventory/hosts.yaml
all:
  children:
    wsl_nodes:
      hosts:
        wsl-fedora-kbc:
          ansible_host: 100.88.131.44
          ansible_user: verlyn13
          ansible_python_interpreter: /usr/bin/python3
          ansible_become: true
          ansible_become_method: sudo
          
          # WSL-specific variables
          device_type: wsl
          os: fedora
          os_version: 42
          location: university_alaska
          platform: wsl2_windows11
          
          # Node characteristics
          availability: business_hours
          network_type: nat
          primary_role: wsl_bridge
          
          # Group memberships
          groups:
            - workstations
            - wsl_nodes
            - fedora_systems
```

## Control Node Actions Required

From the control node (hetzner-hq), run:

### 1. Test Basic Connectivity
```bash
ansible wsl-fedora-kbc -m ping
```

Expected output:
```json
wsl-fedora-kbc | SUCCESS => {
    "changed": false,
    "ping": "pong"
}
```

### 2. Gather System Facts
```bash
ansible wsl-fedora-kbc -m setup
```

### 3. Test Sudo Access
```bash
ansible wsl-fedora-kbc -b -m command -a "whoami"
```

Expected output: `root`

### 4. Apply Common Configuration
```bash
ansible-playbook -l wsl-fedora-kbc playbooks/common.yaml
```

### 5. Apply Full Site Configuration
```bash
ansible-playbook -l wsl-fedora-kbc playbooks/site.yaml
```

## WSL-Specific Considerations

The control node should be aware of these WSL characteristics:

1. **Dynamic IP**: Mitigated by Tailscale (100.88.131.44 is stable)
2. **NAT Networking**: No direct public access
3. **Resource Sharing**: Memory/CPU shared with Windows host
4. **Availability**: Not 24/7 (business hours operation)
5. **systemd**: Partially operational (some services may not work)
6. **Clock Drift**: May need periodic time sync after Windows sleep

## What This Enables

With Phase 2 complete, this WSL node can now:

✅ Receive automated configuration updates  
✅ Participate in centralized management  
✅ Maintain consistency with other mesh nodes  
✅ Get security updates automatically  
✅ Report system facts to control node  
✅ Execute playbooks and roles  

## Next Steps (Phase 3)

Once the control node confirms connectivity:

1. **Service Discovery**: Register available services
2. **Monitoring**: Set up metrics collection
3. **File Sync**: Configure Syncthing for shared files
4. **Backup**: Automated configuration backups
5. **Security Hardening**: Apply security policies

## Troubleshooting

If the control node cannot connect:

```bash
# On WSL node, verify:
tailscale status  # Should show connected
sudo -n true      # Should succeed silently
ss -tlnp | grep 22  # SSH should be listening

# Check ansible readiness:
./scripts/setup/ansible-readiness-check.sh
```

## Repository Updates

This repository has been enhanced with:
- Phase 2 deployment scripts in `scripts/setup/`
- Comprehensive documentation in `PHASE2_DEPLOYMENT.md`
- Automated readiness checking
- WSL-specific configurations
